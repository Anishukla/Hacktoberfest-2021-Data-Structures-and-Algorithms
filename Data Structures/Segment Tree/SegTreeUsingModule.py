"""
    Here I'm using 'SegmentTree' module. This modules helps to avoid the implementation of 
    segmentation tree as we can directly use segment tree function for performing all operations.
    
    Numpy is used in this SegmentTree Module Hence we need install 'numpy' also(if not installed).
    
    Start with Installing Library:
    pip install segment-tree
    pip install numpy

    Here we are fitting our array into segment tree where 't' is taken as object of segment 
    tree 't' will be used for performing operations on that segmentTree.

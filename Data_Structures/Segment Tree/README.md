# Segment Tree
## Segment Tree Naive implementation</u> 
> Using example of standard range sum and point update query naive implementation of segment tree with 4*n memory. (Memory inefficient implementation)

## Segment Tree Optimal implementation - 
> Using example of standard range sum and point update query optimized implementation of segment tree with 2*n memory. (Memory efficient iterative implementation)

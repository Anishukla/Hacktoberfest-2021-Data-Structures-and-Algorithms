# Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..

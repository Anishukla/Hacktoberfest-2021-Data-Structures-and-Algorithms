Basic Probability --->

	In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

	a)	2/3
	b)	5/6
	c)	1/4
	d)	1/6


	Answer -->

		We define E to be the event in which the sum rolled by two evenly-weighted dice is >9.

		The set of outcomes satisfying E is: (4,6) (6,4) (5,5) (6,5) (5,6) (6,6). We can use this to find:
			
							P(E) = abs(E)/abs(S) = 6/36 = 1/6

		We want to find the probability of sum being <=9 . Because we have  and we know that the probability we want comprises the rest of the sample space, we calculate it as follows:
							1-P(E) = 1 - (1/6) = 5/6



More Dice --->

	In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

	a)	1/9
	b)	1/6
	c)	2/3
	d)	5/6


	ANSWER -->
		We define E to be the event satisfying the following conditions:


		1.	The values rolled by both dice are different.
		2.	The sum of the values rolled is 6.

		The set of outcomes satisfying E is: (1,5) , (5,1) , (2,4) , (4,2). We also know that |S| (the size of the sample space) is 36, because there are 6 possible rolls per die and we have 2 dice (6^2 = 36) We can use this to find:
								P(E) = |E|/|S| = 4/36 = 1/9




Compound Event Probability --->

	There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

	Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
	Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
	Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

	One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

	a)	10/63
	b)	2/7
	c)	17/42
	d)	31/126


	ANSWER -->
		Let's define the following events:


		Urn X 
		: E(X,R) Four of the seven balls are red, so P(E(X,R)) = 4/7.
		: E(X,B) Three of the seven balls are black, so P(E(X,B)) = 3/7.

		Urn Y
		: E(Y,R) Five of the nine balls are red, so P(E(Y,R)) = 5/9.
		: E(Y,B) Four of the nine balls are black, so P(E(Y,B)) = 4/9.

		Urn Z
		: E(Z,R) Four of the eight balls are red, so P(E(Z,R)) = 1/2.
		: E(Z,B) Four of the eight balls are black, so P(E(Z,B)) = 1/2.

		Let E(X,Y,Z) be the result of drawing 1 ball from each urn. We care about three scenarios:

		1.	E(R,R,B)
			P(E(R,R,B)) = P(E(X,R)) X P(E(Y,R)) X P(E(Z,B)) = 20/126

		2.	E(R,B,R)
			P(E(R,B,R)) = P(E(X,R)) X P(E(Y,B)) X P(E(Z,R)) = 16/126

		3.	E(B,R,R)
			P(E(B,R,R)) = P(E(X,B)) X P(E(Y,R)) X P(E(Z,R)) = 15/126

		Now, let's find the probabilty for the event E, getting two red and one black balls. Because each event is independent of one another, we can simply sum their probabilities:


		P(2 balls are red and 1 is black) = P(E(R,R,B)) + P(E(R,B,R)) + P(E(B,R,R)) = 51/126 = 17/42

The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 = 0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

ANSWER ---->
	Step 1: Rewrite the 2 lines in proper form

		Rewrite the 2 lines as:

		y = -2 + (-3/4) * x
		x = -7/4 + (-3/4) * y

		so b1 = -3/4 and b2 = -3/4

	Step 2: Apply Pearson's Coefficient formula

		Let p = pearson coefficient
		Let x_std = standard deviation of x
		Let y_std = standard deviation of y

		p = b1 (x_std / y_std)
		p = b2 (y_std / x_std)

		Multiplying these 2 equations together we get
		p^2 = b1 * b2
		p^2 = (-3/4) * (-3/4)
		p^2 = 9/16
		p = 3/4 or -3/4 (depending on correlation of x and y)

	Notice that both of the original line equations have negative slopes, so x and y are negatively correlated by definition. So, p = -3/4
